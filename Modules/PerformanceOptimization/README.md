# PerformanceOptimization PowerShell Module

## Overview
The PerformanceOptimization module provides comprehensive system performance optimization capabilities with advanced monitoring, analysis, and optimization features. It targets multiple performance aspects of the Windows system and offers detailed insights into system performance metrics.

## Features
- CPU optimization
- Memory management
- Process priority optimization
- Service optimization
- Network performance tuning
- Startup optimization
- Performance monitoring
- Resource usage tracking
- Detailed logging system

## Supported Optimization Areas
- Running processes management
- Service configuration
- Startup programs
- System resource allocation
- Network settings
- Power plan settings
- Memory management
- Disk I/O optimization

## Requirements
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Windows operating system
- Administrator privileges for full functionality

## Installation
1. Copy the module folder to one of your PowerShell module directories:
   ```powershell
   $env:PSModulePath -split ';'
   ```
2. Import the module:
   ```powershell
   Import-Module PerformanceOptimization
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```powershell
# Basic performance optimization with default settings
Invoke-PerformanceOptimization

# Optimize specific areas
Invoke-PerformanceOptimization -Areas "CPU","Memory","Network"

# Analyze system performance
Get-SystemPerformanceMetrics
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| VerboseOutput | Switch | No | Enables detailed console output |
| Areas | String[] | No | Specific areas to optimize (e.g., "CPU", "Memory") |
| Force | Switch | No | Skips confirmation prompts |
| SafeMode | Switch | No | Performs only safe optimizations |

## Logging
- Automatic log creation for each operation
- Timestamped entries
- Performance metrics tracking
- Optimization action logging
- Success/failure tracking
- Logs stored in module's Logs directory

## Error Handling
- Robust error handling for all operations
- Safe operation termination
- Detailed error logging
- System state preservation
- Rollback capabilities

## Best Practices
1. Run with administrator privileges
2. Use -SafeMode for initial optimization
3. Review logs for optimization history
4. Regular performance monitoring
5. Schedule periodic optimizations

## Security Considerations
- Requires elevated privileges
- Safe system modifications
- Configuration backup
- Rollback support
- Confirmation prompts
- Logging of all changes

## Performance Features
- Real-time monitoring
- Resource usage analysis
- Optimization recommendations
- System health checks
- Performance trending

## Output Information
The module provides detailed optimization results including:
- Performance metrics
- Resource utilization
- Optimization actions
- System improvements
- Recommendations

Example console output:
```
Performance Optimization Results:
CPU Usage: 80% → 45%
Memory Available: 2GB → 4GB
Services Optimized: 5
Startup Items Adjusted: 3
```

## Version History
- 1.0.0: Initial release
  - Core optimization functionality
  - Performance monitoring
  - Multi-area optimization

## Notes
- Some optimizations require administrator privileges
- System restart may be required for full effect
- Performance improvements vary by system
- Regular monitoring recommended
- Some settings may reset after updates

## Troubleshooting
1. Run with -VerboseOutput for detailed logs
2. Check log files for error information
3. Verify administrator privileges
4. Ensure system stability before optimization
